NLP
learning -  learn  -- learning , learned , -- present , past   -- increasing his memory, 
python -- python  -- python  --    NN                          -- coding language 
working - work - working , worked                              -- Action, doing some activity 
infosys -- infosys - infosys                                    -- company

NLP : Text analyze on the corpus information( corpus -- words)
1. tokenization :  diving the sentence by word or special characters 

I  am  learning  python  . i  am   n't  working  on  infosys   11  tokens

2. stop words : the word which is used to connect the sentence or words or framing the sentence/ filer word
   i , am , in, was, on  - this word when it is alone it will not have any meaning 

learning  python n't  working infosys

3. Stemming  : it is one of the text processing task which will reduce to their core word or root word 
  working , worked  -- work ( root word)

  learning -- learn
  python   -- pyth( over stemming ) -- python 
  working  -- worki( under stemming ) - work
  infosys -- infos

  4. lemmatization : identifying the core word or root word. lemma( 99 %) 

  learning -- learn
  python -- python
  working -- work
  infosys -- infosys

  POS Tagging ( part of the speech tagging )( text generation )
  learning -- verb
  python -- noun 
  working -- verb
  infosys - noun 
  from , about -- prepostion 

  I am learning python|swimming|singing 

  chunking:  It is to identify the phrases ( group of token )
  I  am  learning  python  . chunk1
  i  am   n't  working  on  infosys - chunk2

  regular expression : chunk grammer : " pronoun adjective  verb noun " 

  
  simplify the learning , storing the information and retrieving the information fast 

  NER( Named entity recognition) - name entities are noun phrases that refers to specific location
  , people, organization , date, time , facitiy, history.. 

  organization -- infosys 
  coding Language -- python
