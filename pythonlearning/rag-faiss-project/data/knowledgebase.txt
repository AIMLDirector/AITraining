Section 1: The Solar System
The Solar System consists of the Sun and everything bound to it by gravity, including the eight planets, dwarf planets, dozens of moons, and millions of asteroids, comets, and meteoroids. The four inner, terrestrial planets are Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. The four outer planets are gas giants Jupiter and Saturn and ice giants Uranus and Neptune.

Section 2: Earth's Atmosphere
Earth's atmosphere is a layer of gases surrounding the planet Earth and retained by Earth's gravity. It protects life on Earth by absorbing ultraviolet solar radiation, warming the surface through heat retention (the greenhouse effect), and reducing temperature extremes between day and night. It is composed primarily of nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%), with trace amounts of other gases like argon, carbon dioxide, and water vapor.

Section 3: Photosynthesis
Photosynthesis is the process used by plants, algae, and certain bacteria to convert light energy into chemical energy, which is then used to fuel the organisms' activities. This chemical energy is stored in carbohydrate molecules, such as sugars, which are synthesized from carbon dioxide and water. Oxygen is released as a byproduct.
